// How many licks?

//Just how many licks does it take to get to the center of a tootsie pop?  let's find out.
// we'll start by getting some information from our user

// we first need to find out how old the person is.  we will store this value in the age variable
var age = prompt("How old are you?");
// how big a sweet tooth a person has is the most important factor.  we'll store that in this variable
var sweetTooth = prompt("On a scale of 1-10 how big is your sweet tooth?");
