// Expression Worksheet: Dog Years


// Calculate the age of a dog in dog years


var actualAge = 1; //Sparky the dog is one year old
const dogYears = 7; //Dogs age 7 times faster than humans so 1 human year is 7 dog years

//to figure out how old Sparky is in dog years we have to multiple his age by 7 and assign that to dogAge
var dogAge = actualAge * dogYears
 
console.log(dogAge);
